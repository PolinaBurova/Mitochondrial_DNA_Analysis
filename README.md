# Mitochondrial DNA Analysis

This project involves the analysis of human mitochondrial DNA using Biopython. The analysis includes tasks such as calculating GC content, identifying motifs, and visualizing nucleotide composition. 

## Data Source

The data was extracted from the NCBI RefSeq database, specifically from the following link:
[GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/vertebrate_mammalian/Homo_sapiens/reference/GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14/)

## Files

- `notebooks/Human_Mitochondria.py`: Script to extract the human mitochondrial DNA sequence from the provided data.
- `data/human_mitochondrial.fasta`: The extracted mitochondrial DNA sequence in FASTA format.
- `notebooks/Mitochondrial_DNA_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the detailed analysis of the mitochondrial DNA sequence.


## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the Python script to extract the mitochondrial DNA.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook to perform the analysis.
